annote = {An alternative approach follows the model of a trusted
personal assistant who reads and processes messages on
the boss’s behalf, helping the boss to sustain focus on
critical tasks and stay organized. The assistant uses
whatever tools are appropriate – an email client to read,
organize, and respond to messages; task or project
management software to maintain a to-do list; diverse
application programs to prepare or execute tasks. The
assistant does not rely on engineered integration of these
capabilities into a single tool but instead uses knowledge of
user tasks and how the tools support those tasks to
integrate their functions dynamically.

Paper proposes using tf-idf cosine similarity. Paper also proposes using k-nearest neighbors (k = 30) with the same metric and ranking recipients according to the similarity scores they have in each of the k neighbors.
        
Paper also uses non-textual features, such as TO fields, to predict CC and BCC fields as well. Further, paper considers "chronological" features, such as how recently the user emailed somebody in the last 20, 50, or 100 messages.

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a formal email workflow model based on traditional email, which enables the user to define and execute ad-hoc workflows in an intuitive way. This model paves the way for semantic annotation of implicit, well-defined workflows, thus making them explicit and exposing the missing information in a machine processable way. Grounding this work within the Social Semantic Desktop 1 via appropriate ontologies means that this information can be exploited for the benefit of the user. This will have a direct impact on their personal information management - given email is not just a major channel of data exchange between desktops, but it also serves as a virtual working environment where people collaborate. Thus the presented workflow model will have a concrete manifestation in the creation, organization and exchange of semantic desktop data.},

abstract = {The emergence of online crowdsourcing services such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, presents us huge opportunities to distribute micro-tasks at an unprecedented rate and scale. Unfortunately, the high verification cost and the unstable employment relationship give rise to opportunistic behaviors of workers, which in turn exposes the requesters to quality risks. Currently, most requesters rely on redundancy to identify the correct answers. However, existing techniques cannot separate the true (unrecoverable) error rates from the (recoverable) biases that some workers exhibit, which would lead to incorrect assessment of worker quality. Furthermore, massive redundancy is expensive, increasing significantly the cost of crowdsourced solutions. In this paper, we present an algorithm that can easily separate the true error rates from the biases. Also, we describe how to seamlessly integrate the existence of ``gold" data for learning the quality of workers. Next, we bring up an approach for actively testing worker quality in order to quicky identify spammers or malicious workers. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm.},

Shared email usage in various types of orgs. see page 114. See p 116 for the challenges assistants face.
        
We reported five categories of work by the human assistants: 
Pre-Processing: Assistants frequently gathered additional information and prepared items in other ways before passing them to the manager.Filtering/Prioritizing: Assistants selected the messages that needed the manager’s attention, and often ordered them by priority. They also determined if any required that they interrupt the manager immediately.
Adding Relevant Information: Assistants provided additional information, such as a reminder of a sender’s affiliation, both when first presenting a message and while the manager read it.
Delegating Complex Tasks: Assistants frequently performed a number of complex steps in response to a single, often brief, request.
Peripheral Awareness/Drawing Attention to Items of Interest: Assistants frequently pointed out information they thought their manager’s would find important, such as the mention of a colleague in a message.
        
We were also surprised to learn that the company in question published email addresses for several key executives, and that all of the emails to those addresses were read by the same clerical worker. The clerical worker had no formal background or training for this task; it appeared that the worker and her supervision had defined the responsibilities in an ad hoc manner, over time.
        
Reinvention occurs when users discover new, unanticipated uses for existing technologies (Tornatsky and Fleischer, 1992). In our study, users treated message lists as performance reports, comment fields as instructions, mailboxeswho else is in that place with you as identity statements, and folders as action-requests or status indicators.},

The insights gained can not only help psychologists do their research better but also provide useful insights into the basics of social interaction and cognition. This chapter reviews some of the many recent advances in the literature, including the following: New findings challenge a long-standing prejudice against studies with low response rates; innovative techniques for pretesting questionnaires offer opportunities for improving measurement validity; surprising effects of the verbal labels put on rating scale points have been identified, suggesting optimal approaches to scale labeling; respondents interpret questions on the basis of the norms of everyday conversation, so violations of those conventions introduce error; some measurement error thought to have been attributable to social desirability response bias now appears to be due to other factors instead, thus encouraging different approaches to fixing such problems; and a new theory of satisficing in questionnaire responding offers parsimonious explanations for a range of response patterns long recognized by psychologists and survey researchers but previously not well understood.},

"Email provides a convenient transport mechanism because the vast majority of users already have well-known addresses (no additional directories are needed), messages can be sent regardless of whether the recipient has per- formed any configuration, and existing email clients provide a use- ful record of messages exchanged. The combination of these fac- tors makes semantic email a lightweight, general approach for au- tomating many tasks that would be impractical with other systems."

annote = {Executive + Assistant working on the same inbox.
        
We reported five categories of work by the human assistants: 
Pre-Processing: Assistants frequently gathered additional information and prepared items in other ways before passing them to the manager.Filtering/Prioritizing: Assistants selected the messages that needed the manager’s attention, and often ordered them by priority. They also determined if any required that they interrupt the manager immediately.
Adding Relevant Information: Assistants provided additional information, such as a reminder of a sender’s affiliation, both when first presenting a message and while the manager read it.
Delegating Complex Tasks: Assistants frequently performed a number of complex steps in response to a single, often brief, request.
Peripheral Awareness/Drawing Attention to Items of Interest: Assistants frequently pointed out information they thought their manager’s would find important, such as the mention of a colleague in a message.
        
We were also surprised to learn that the company in question published email addresses for several key executives, and that all of the emails to those addresses were read by the same clerical worker. The clerical worker had no formal background or training for this task; it appeared that the worker and her supervision had defined the responsibilities in an ad hoc manner, over time.
        
Reinvention occurs when users discover new, unanticipated uses for existing technologies (Tornatsky and Fleischer, 1992). In our study, users treated message lists as performance reports, comment fields as instructions, mailboxeswho else is in that place with you as identity statements, and folders as action-requests or status indicators.},

Interface agents are computer programs that employ Articificial Intelligence techniques to provide active assistance to a user with computer-based tasks. Agents radically change the current user experience, through the metaphor that an agent can act as a personal assistant. The agent acquires its competence by learning from the user as well as from agents assisting other users. Several prototype agents have been built using this technique, including agents that provide personalized assistance with meeting scheduling, electronic mail handling, electronic news filtering and selection of entertainment.},

These agents have to rely on a lot of domain-specific knowledge, so AI and machine learning techniques are valuable here.

automatically identifying action items (tasks) in
email messages. SmartMail presents the user with
a task-focused summary of a message. The
summary consists of a list of action items extracted
from the message. The user can add these action
items to their “to do” list.

@article{Effron2010,
abstract = {Three studies examined when and why an actor's prior good deeds make observers more willing to excuse--or license--his or her subsequent, morally dubious behavior. In a pilot study, actors' good deeds made participants more forgiving of the actors' subsequent transgressions. In Study 1, participants only licensed blatant transgressions that were in a different domain than actors' good deeds; blatant transgressions in the same domain appeared hypocritical and suppressed licensing (e.g., fighting adolescent drug use excused sexual harassment, but fighting sexual harassment did not). Study 2 replicated these effects and showed that good deeds made observers license ambiguous transgressions (e.g., behavior that might or might not represent sexual harassment) regardless of whether the good deeds and the transgression were in the same or in a different domain--but only same-domain good deeds did so by changing participants' construal of the transgressions. Discussion integrates two models of why licensing occurs.},

abstract = {CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are widespread security measures on the World Wide Web that prevent automated programs from abusing online services. They do so by asking humans to perform a task that computers cannot yet perform, such as deciphering distorted characters. Our research explored whether such human effort can be channeled into a useful purpose: helping to digitize old printed material by asking users to decipher scanned words from books that computerized optical character recognition failed to recognize. We showed that this method can transcribe text with a word accuracy exceeding 99\%, matching the guarantee of professional human transcribers. Our apparatus is deployed in more than 40,000 Web sites and has transcribed over 440 million words.},
