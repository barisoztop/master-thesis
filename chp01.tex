\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:Intro}
Increased Internet usage turned email into a tool for communication replacing telephone and regular mail \citep{Norman2000,Madden2003}. There are many use cases showing that email plays a huge role as a communication tool. Some of them include marketing for engaging clients, customer support for offering assistance after sale, surveying people to get their opinion on a topic, and many other cases showing that email become essential part of our daily life.

However, when the amount of people you want to reach increases, the way how you compose the emails and extract the information changes. Because, the personal effort will not be enough anymore to individually tailor the emails according to each recipient or reading all the respondent's emails to extract the answers that you seek for. As a result, researchers tend to use online or software tools to send out generic emails to recipients with a non-adequate personalization, which is known as one of the important factor to increase response rates \citep{Dillman1991,Schaefer1998}. Such emails are treated with low priority, which results low response rates at the end \citep[page 272]{DillmanDonA.SmythJoleneD.Christian2009}.

There are several products in the market focusing on email communication and data collection. A \ac{CRM} application keeps track of a company's communication with their clients. A Help desk application offers a platform to solve customers' problems or provide guidance regarding products. Email marketing applications help out sending commercial messages to groups of people. Finally, survey applications aid to conduct online surveys to get people's opinions and behaviors. One of the common properties of all these applications is their dependency on email communication. However, none of these mentioned tools offers a complete workflow to help out a researcher to communicate by email with a great amount of people in a personalized manner and as easy as possible like communicating with an individual.

The goal of this thesis is to understand the possible workflow of a personalized mass email communication, and to show that it is possible to reach a great amount of people by keeping the communication personalized at the same time. A complete system, named Myriad, has been developed to demonstrate the practical aspects of this idea.

\section{Email as a Data Collection Method}
\label{sec:1:EmailDataCol}

Nearly 600\% growth rate on world-wide internet usage between 2000 to 2012 makes Europe's 63\% and North America's 80\% overall population internet usage proportion \citep{InternetWorldStats2012}. Email is ranked as the most popular online activity along with search engine usage with 92\% of online adult users \citep{Purcell2011}. Also, the connectivity and the flexibility have been increased with the introduction of smart phones and tablet devices \citep{Madden2008}. In addition to these facts, email has low cost and quick turnover compared to regular mail or telephone communication \citep{Zikmund2007}. Therefore, email as a part of communication is considered as a viable option for data collection as well \citep{Zikmund2007}.
\vspace{1cm}

There are several reasons for data collection depending on the situation. However, purposes of data collection can be group under the following three categories \citep{Sue2011} \citep[pages 92--94]{Babbie2010}:

\begin{compactenum}
	\item To explore and get information about a topic
	\item To describe the events and the situations
	\item To explain things by questioning
\end{compactenum}

To illustrate these purposes to see how we can use email to explore, describe, and explain things, let's suppose that we have an online learning platform offering various courses publicly:

\paragraph{Exploration}
Offering online courses is a relatively new trend; therefore we do not have much previous knowledge about the topic. To explore the popularity of the platform, we need to ask the platform's users questions: Why are they attending our online courses? Have they taken any online courses before? What are their income levels? Figuring out the answers to these questions will help us to improve the system or to decide its future. For example, the aggregated answers to the income level question will make us decide whether to charge the users for their usage or offer it for free and find some sponsors to make it viable.

\paragraph{Description}
Our goal can be to describe characteristics of the online learning platform's users. The questions helping us to describe this can be: Where do they come from? What are their age ranges? Have they attended a college? At the end, we might end up with a user profile like: at the age of 16 -- 22, who have never attended to a college, and coming from less developed countries. Knowing our users' portfolio according to this outcome can help us to attract organizations who have already had engagements to support those countries' young population. Hence, they can leverage our platform as a tool to reach those populations.

\paragraph{Explanation}
We figured out that our platform's users' age range is between 16 -- 22 in our descriptive study. The reasons of why this ended up like that make our explanatory purpose. The questions like how often they are connected online or have they attended a college or a similar high level education institute might help us to find out the answer of why young people use our platform more frequently than older people. Collecting such statistics may help us to develop an explanation to a topic.

Since all of our registered users provided their email addresses as a primary and mandatory contact medium, we can use email to conduct our data collection whether the reason is to explore, describe or explain the user trends on our online learning platform.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:2:Problem}

To date, email as a popular medium for communication has many use cases including to reach groups of people to explore, describe, and explain things. However, when the group's size gets larger, it becomes difficult from the researchers' perspective to manage the state of the communication as in small groups. Therefore, researchers tend to write generic emails ignoring or using inadequate recipient specific information with the help of a software or online tool in the emails. This results low response rates since recipients become aware of being part of a large group, hence feeling less important and valued, as well as the chance to volunteer to reply the email gets less. On the other hand, if researchers individually tailor those emails according to recipients, it will require much more additional efforts and as a result costs, hence reducing the advantages of using email as a communication medium.
\vspace{1cm}

Even though, there are many solutions in the market to support email communication, there is no individual product allowing researchers to reach larger groups with minimum effort and keeping the communication personalized at the same time.
\vspace{1cm}

The main goal of this thesis is to show that personalized communication with large groups is possible when a proper workflow is provided. To achieve this goal:

\begin{compactenum}
	\item Examine the workflow of an email communication with large groups and possible exceptional cases on this flow
	\item Investigate the effects of email content's personalization on the response rates
	\item Describe how an adequate amount of personalization in emails can be supplied
	\item Comparison of  existing products claiming to provide solutions on email communication and collection of respondents' information
	\item Describe the design and implementation of an application satisfying the mentioned workflow to aid researchers including the initial prototype
	\item Show how assistants can support the mentioned workflow  
	\item Real life use cases of the application and its users opinions about the application, and latest statistical information giving insight about how and in which way the application is used by its users.
\end{compactenum}
\vspace{1cm}

This thesis also contributes on the following areas:

\begin{compactenum}
	\item Email as a data collection method
	\item Surveying with email
	\item Defining a workflow on a mass email communication
	\item Possible crowd sourced assistant usage
	\item Personalization of email content
\end{compactenum}

--> We use email also more daily communication, onlar bize soru soruyor iletisim olusuyor.

(paper E21 p 442, and E5)To date, researchers have used Web page-based surveys to study large groups of on-line users (e.g. Kehoe, Pitkow and Morton, 1997) and e-mail surveys to study smaller, more homogenous on-line user groups (e.g. Parker, 1992; Smith, 1997; Tse et al, 1995). However, it appears that a relatively untapped use for the Internet is to use e-mail is to survey broader Internet populations on both a national and international basis. WRITE the problems in here as well form that paper. Problems related from researchers perspective. Also mention briefly about the purpose and design of the those surveys.


Reaching out large-scale of people via internet is a fast and cost efficient way comparing with postal mail or telephone. Therefore, email has been used not just for research, but also for marketing, customer support, and other data collection purposes. However, getting an acceptable response rates on the sent out emails requires additional efforts from the researchers' side. This thesis investigates a communication system which contributes increasing the response rates while minimizing the burden on the researchers' side. 

As aforementioned studies showed that different forms of personalization increase the response rates in email communication. However, it has become very easy to add personalized information into email thanks to the softwares. Dillman, et al. (2009) stated that over-personalization using software tools might easily result impersonal messages.

Moreover, experienced email users can identify if a message is written by a person or computer generated by looking appearance of one's name in certain locations, and similar patterns for other information \citep[page 272]{DillmanDonA.SmythJoleneD.Christian2009}. Therefore, it becomes difficult to have a correct amount and tone of personalization. The more daily interaction with digital devices will make the true authentic personalization more rare, hence achieving it will make it more important and effective \citep[page 238]{DillmanDonA.SmythJoleneD.Christian2009}.
