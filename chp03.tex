\chapter{Evaluation of Existing Tools}
\label{chp:3:EvalExisToo}
After building the foundation on related work on personalized mass email communication, this section will evaluate existing systems available in the market. 

\section{Tool Categories and Their Relation with Thesis}
\label{sec:3.1:SystCate}

There are three different tool catagories that are related with this thesis, and focusing on email communication directly or indirectly. Followings section will give a brief description of those are these product types, and their relation with this thesis:

\subsection{Customer Relationship Management (CRM)}
\label{subsec:3.1.1:Cust}
A \ac{CRM} application helps to manage customer relationships effectively, which is a topic studied both by academia and industry in recent years. Such applications play an important role in the marketing where organizations use more customer oriented instead of product or brand oriented marketing strategies. Therefore, each customer's economic value is different to the company, and organizations' customer relation strategies require to adapt their customer offerings and communication strategy personalized according to individual customer \citep{Reinartz2004}.

One of the reason why this thesis considers \ac{CRM} applications to evaluate is its communication aspects of a company with their clients. Another reason is, as it is mentioned at section 2.3, the adequate amount of personalization in emails is crucial on response rates, and people's increased daily interactions with digital world make the true authentic personalization more rare. To achieve such a level of personalization requires getting know each recipient very well by considering not only the recent conversation, but also earlier conversations, and all the information that might be extracted from those conversations helping to build a relation with respondents. Since a \ac{CRM} system aims to keep track of each customer history regarding a product or a brand, such a data store could be leveraged to add adequate amount of personalized information to a email conversation. 

\subsection{Help Desk}
\label{subsec:3.1.2:HelpDeskSoft}
Another application that focuses on a company and its relation with their clients is help desk applications. It's main purpose to provide information and support related to a company's products and services to their customers. As a part of knowledge acquisition, help desks supports both sides of the communication in a way that while customers or end users find the knowledge they need, and the people who provide help by making the knowledge available and reusable \citep{Halverson2004}.
\vspace{1cm}

Reusing the existing knowledge requires to structure the captured knowledge. This is where it makes the relation with this thesis. Because, a help desk application provides a workflow where both parties develop a communication where person who needs assistance describes his/her problem while people who provide help identify the problem by looking earlier cases or asking questions to clarify the initial question. This also requires the cooperation of assistants while providing help to a problem at which one person might have previous experience to guide other assistants. As a result, a help desk application is similar to a mass email communication where a researcher initiate an open ended questionnaire, extracting information from the coming replies, and organize them according to the answers that researcher seeks for. In addition, respondents might also come up with some questions to clarify things, where existing answers can easily be reused. Having such a email conversation with large groups require great amount of effort from a researcher's side, where he might assign tasks to distribute the efforts to other researchers to deal with the large size of the group.


\subsection{Email Marketing}
\label{subsec:3.1.3:EmaiMarkt}


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:3.2:Meth}

Help desk software offers a platform to solve customers' problems or provide guidance regarding products. Email marketing applications help out sending commercial messages to group of people. Finally, survey applications aid to conduct online surveys to get people's opinions and behaviors. One of the common properties of all of these applications is their dependency on email communication. However, none of these mentioned tools offers a complete workflow to help out a researcher to make an email communication possible with a great amount of people in a personalized manner and as easy as possible like communicating with an individual.
