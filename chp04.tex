\chapter{Initial Idea and the Prototype}
\label{chp:4:InitIdeaProt}
In this chapter, a mass communication schema, and possible exceptional cases will be introduces. Afterwards, the initial prototype will be reviewed, and its drawback will be discussed.

\section{Mass Email Communication Concept}
\label{sec:4.1:MassEmaiCommConc}

When a researcher initiate a mass email communication, there will be many cases that cannot be predicted beforehand, but affects the flow of the communication. Respondents may come up with clarifying questions to initial question, email addresses that are considered active might not be exist anymore, an auto responder might been set since the respondent is not available during a temporary period, and many more cases.

In section~\ref{sec:1:EmailDataCol}, the online learning platform scenario was used to illustrate the possible reasons for email data collection. If we consider it in here again, assuming that we are exploring our users to improve our platform. Therefore, we start sending out emails to our registered users to get their permission to ask some questions. This initial email might be similar to listing~\ref{lst:EmaiInvtQest}.
\vspace{1cm}

\begin{lstlisting}[float, language=, caption={[Email Invitation to Questionnaire for Online Learning Platform]Email Invitation to Questionnaire for Online Learning Platform}, label={lst:EmaiInvtQest}]
Dear John,

you have recently attended the "Cryptography" and the "Natural Language Processing" courses. Do you mind if you answer some questions regarding these courses?

The questionnaire will take only 15 minutes, and it will help us a lot to improve our platform.

Kind regards,
your online course team.
\end{lstlisting}

After the initial invitation email to get their permission for upcoming questionnaire. There are possible answers that we might expect:

\begin{compactenum}
	\item Yes, I would like to involve
	\item No, I am quite busy 
	\item I could involve, but I am busy till the end of this month
	\item An automated message from recipients to indicate his or her vacation period
\end{compactenum}

Figure~\ref{fig:EmailDiagram} shows a simplified version of this scenario. The people who accepted our invitation will get a second email including the questionnaire. As soon as they responds back with the answers of the questions, we will return a thank you email for the participation. For those who did not accept the invitation will get a motivation email to encourage for the next time. Next, some people returned conditional acceptance, which we collected them under a "maybe" case. Again, there might be several reason for them for instance they might involve in the the questionnaire but they are busy during that week. Hence, we could reply with an email telling an opinion for their situation like if people attend other exams, we can wish a good luck for it, and afterwards we can mention about a reminder email that will be send out after a time period where participants mentioned in their response. After the reminder email, we will expect to get a acceptance of the questionnaire email. Then conversation will continue as with the people who initially accepted to involve our research. The communication with auto respond case is not clear, therefore the communication will not go further with those people until they reply us in the near future. However, if the auto respond provides some information, we could also set a reminder for a upcoming date to send a reminder email.

\end{figure}

Above mentioned sample scenario can be handled manually with individual efforts for a small group of participants. These manual effort will involve following points:

\begin{compactitem}
	\item Figure out the courses that participants attended for our email list, and add them to the content of the email for each person
	\item Write a generic answer for those who accepted to involve to the questionnaire, and write the questions
	\item Write a generic motivation email to support those who did not accept to involve to the questionnaire
	\item Go over for all the "maybe" cases, and record the date information if they mention a time period that they will be willing to participate, but busy at the moment.
	\item Write a generic email to those "maybe" cases mention about the reminder that we will send in the time period that they mentioned. This email can involve a couple sentences to give a feedback and share the feelings about respondent's situation that make them not to involve to the questionnaire at the moment.
	\item Go over for all the "auto-respond" cases to figure out if there is any condition that we need to ignore those people at all for the upcoming questionnaires in case they change their email addresses, or any date that can be recorded to setup a reminder email later on.
	\item Send a thank you email to those who replied with the answers of the questionnaire
\end{compactitem}
\vspace{1cm}

However, when the amount of participants is great, the possibility of doing this manual work will get harder, and the personalization that is added into emails will get less. For example, for the "maybe cases", we will not be able to give a feedback or share the feelings about respondent's situation, but just write an email to mention that we will send them a reminder later on. More over, these are simplified possible cases. There might be much more cases in real life situation, where it might require to ignore some respondents totally or writing a generic email by again ignoring the context of their email since individual efforts will not be enough to write custom emails for those cases. In such a case, we might even break up the communication forever, or results in the side effects of diffusion of responsibility theory as mentioned in section~\ref{sec:2.3:PersEmai}.
\vspace{1cm}

In the figure~\ref{fig:ChartEffortCustom}, you see that the personalization of emails is directly proportional to the effort to compose those emails. The shaded are on the graph represent the situation, when researchers use an application to create mass email communication, while the area marked with star represent the standard where where it is hard to reach with the available applications.
